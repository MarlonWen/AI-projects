This program finds the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them. 
For example, the shortest path between Jennifer Lawrence and Tom Hanks is 2: Jennifer Lawrence is connected to 
Kevin Bacon by both starring in “X-Men: First Class,” and Kevin Bacon is connected to Tom Hanks by both starring 
in “Apollo 13.” 

The data folder contains a large amount of random data consisting of various movies(movie_id, title, year of release),
people(person_id, name, birth) and stars(person_id, movie_id). However, the data does not include every single movie 
or actor that has ever existed, so if you wish to add to the data, you may choose to do so.

To run the program, download all of the files, make sure the directory is correct (using the cd or change directory command),
open the degrees.py file and run it on python. 

To use the program, when prompted, type the name of 2 actors (list of actors can be found in the data folder).
